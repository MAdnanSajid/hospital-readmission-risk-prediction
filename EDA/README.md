# EDA – Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction

## Overview
This folder contains results and outputs from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction project.  
EDA helps understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare features for machine learning models.

## Contents
- **Note:** The Jupyter notebook with the EDA code is located in the `notebooks/` folder: `notebooks/eda_hospital_readmission.ipynb`.

## EDA Steps
1. **Data Loading** – Loaded dataset from `data/` folder.  
2. **Data Inspection** – Checked shape, columns, missing values, and basic statistics.  
3. **Univariate Analysis** – Visualized distributions of numerical and categorical variables.  
4. **Bivariate Analysis** – Explored relationships between features and the target variable (`Readmission`).  
5. **Correlation Analysis** – Heatmaps and correlation matrices.  
6. **Feature Insights** – Identified features that may be important for prediction.  

## Purpose
- Understand the data before model building.  
- Detect and handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.  
- Generate plots and statistics to communicate findings.  
- Prepare features for feature engineering and machine learning models.  

## How to Use
1. Open `notebooks/eda_hospital_readmission.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.  
2. Run cells sequentially to reproduce all visualizations and insights.
